# FakeNewsDetection
ML Project to detect fake or real news from a given CSV file. 

# Skills Demonstrated in the Project

1. **Python Programming:** My ability to write Python code proficiency is essential for me to complete all aspects of this project, including data manipulation, analysis, and understanding of the  *pandas* and *sklearn* libraries.

2. **Data Handling with Pandas:** My understanding and manipulation of data using *pandas* is crucial because this project required me to read data from CSV files, clean the data, and extract relevant features.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** My knowledge of data cleaning and preprocessing is demonstrated in the removal of punctuation, special characters, and unwanted elements from the news data.

4. **Bag of Words (BoW) Representation:** Understanding and implementing a Bag of Words model is a fundamental skill I have learned for text-based machine learning. 

5. **Feature Engineering:** My implementation of feature engineering by selecting relevant words and building a vocabulary for classification showcases my understanding of how data is used in supervised learning algorithms and the importance of removing unnecessary information to yield a higher accuracy.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:** I implemented a KNN algorithm for this classification task and it involved training the KNN classifier and evaluating its performance using the *sklearn* library. This shows that I have a solid understanding of machine learning concepts and the practical application of a supervised learning algorithm.
